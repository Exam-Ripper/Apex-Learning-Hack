We can set the subject, brainly usage, and the action interval duration

The subject lets us choose which to excel the bot's AI in. I will be choosing History for this one.



I will turn on Use Brainly, because I want the highest accuracy possible.

I will also change my Interval Duration to 0.5 seconds, as that will be the most human like.

## 4. Click start. This will start the automation, and make the bot finish the test.![Image](https://github.com/Exam-Ripper/Apex-learning-bot-answers/blob/main/step3.png?raw=true)

## 5.  After a little bit, the test will be completed, and you can move onto other assignments. ![Image](https://github.com/Exam-Ripper/Apex-learning-bot-answers/blob/main/step4.png?raw=true)
